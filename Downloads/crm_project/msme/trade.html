			<p><a name="background"></a><h3>Background of Export Promotion</h3>
			<p>Exports from the small scale sector over a period of time have acquired great significance in India's foreign trade. The MSME Sector today constitutes a very important segment of India's economy and it accounts for nearly 40 of the gross value of output in the manufacturing sector and about 50% of the total exports from the country. Direct exports from the MSME Sector accounts for 35% of the total exports.
			<p>Export Promotion from the small scale sector has been accorded a high priority in the India's export promotion strategy. The small industries due to their inherent strengths of low capital investment, high employment generation, maximum utilisation of capacity, flexibility in operation, etc. are highly conducive for rapid industrialization and generation of export surpluses.
			<p>An idea about the contribution of small scale sector in country's total exports can be had from the table given below:

			<td><p><a name="export"></a><h3>Export Assistance & Facilities </h3>
			<p>Export Promotion from Small Scale Sector has received utmost priority of the Government. Every Policy formulated for achieving growth in exports have a number of incentives to small scale exporters so as to maximise export earnings. Such incentives include :
			<p>
			<ol type=1>
			 <li>Free import of capital goods/raw material and other essential inputs, and in certain cases duty free or with concessional rate of Custom Duty, so as to ensure higher production for exports. </li>
			<li> With a view to make Indian products competitive in the world markets, a large number of incentives were  provided to the exporters from time to time. Such incentives include refund of duties paid on the raw material used in export production by a system of Duty-Draw-Back, Pre and Post shipment Credit to the exporters at concessional rate of interest, etc. </li>
			<li>Export Policy of the Government has remained liberal as there were hardly any restrictions on export of items from small scale sector. Export Procedures have been simplified from time to time so as to promote exports from the small scale sector. The efforts of the Government have always been to regulate and simplify procedures so as to create a congenial environment for the exporting community. </li>
			</ol>
<div align=right><A HREF="#Legal"></div></a>
			<p><a name="strategies"></a><h3>Export Strategies for Small Scale Sector </h3>
			<p>Broadly, exports strategy for small sector includes simplification of export Procedures and to provide incentives to the small sector for higher production and to maximise export earnings. With a view to formulate trade policy with simplified procedures which are conducive for export promotion. Export-Import policy is formulated after consulting various trade bodies like Federation of Indian Export Organisation, Federation of  Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry and different Export Promotion Councils, etc.
<div align=right><A HREF="#Legal"></div></a>
			<p><a name="policy"></a><h3>Export-Import Policy for Small Scale Sector </h3>
			<p><ol type=1>
			<li><u>Recognition of Export Houses/ Trading Houses, etc.</u></li>
				<br><br>With a view to recognise established exporters so that they may build marketing infrastructure and expertise required for export  production, merchant as well as manufacturer exporters, EOU etc. are recognised as Export House, Trading Houses, Star Trading Houses and Super Star Trading Houses on the basis of certain criteria as laid down in the Export-Import Policy 1997-2002. The eligibility criteria for such recognition is based either on the basis of FOB or Net Foreign Exchange value of exports of goods and services made directly by the exporters during the preceding three licensing years or the preceding licensing year. In an attempt to encourage exports from the small scale sector, the exports made by small scale sector manufacturer-exporters are given triple weightage for the purpose of recognition as EH/TH/STH/SSTH. Accordingly, in terms of  provisions contained at para 12.7(a) of the Exim Policy 1997-2002 (amended upto 31/3/99), triple weightage on FOB or net foreign exchange on the export o				f products manufactured and exported by units in the small scale industry (MSME)/ Tiny sector/ Cottage sector and double weightage on FOB or net foreign exchange to merchant exporter exporting products reserved for MSME units and manufactured by units in the MSME/Tiny Sector is give. These Export Houses, Trading Houses, etc. are entitled to certain benefits under the current Export-Import  Policy.
			<br><br><li><u>Special Import Licence (SIL) </u></li>
				<br><br>Exporters recognised as Export Houses, Star Trading House, Trading Houses, etc. Are eligible for grant of  special Import Licence (SIL) @ certain percentage of their FOB value of exports/NFE. However, 2 percent additional SIL is granted for exports of Products manufactured by units registered as MSME, provided the exports of these products is more than 50% of the exports during the period (provisions contained in para 12.7(b) of Hand Book of Procedure 1997-2000 refers).
			<br><br><li><u>Eligibility condition for Small Scale Exporters for SIL </u></li>
				<br><br>In case of small scale exporters holding ISO 9000 (Series) or IS/ISO 9000 Series of quality certification, the FOB value (excluding deemed exports) of exports for becoming eligible for Special Import Licence (SIL) @4% of the FOB value of exports is Rs. 30 million and above in the preceding licensing year or on an average FOB value of Rs. 10 million  or above during the preceding three licensing years instead of the limit of Rs. 50 million and Rs. 20 million respectively prescribed for others (Para 11.11 (a) & (b) of Hand Book of Procedures 1997-2002 refers in this context).
			<h3> Salient Features of the Exim Policy - 1997-2002</h3>
<!--
			<li><u>Duty Exemption Scheme made Flexible </u></li>
			<br><br>A provision for annual advance licence has been made to reduce the avoidable interface between the exporter  and the DGFT. This facility would provide necessary flexibility in the import of duty free inputs. The exporter would now be able to import any prescribed inputs as per input-output norms right through the year without approaching DGFT. The licence would be issued without stipulation of minimum value addition.
			<br><br><li><u>Benefit of Zero Duty EPCG Scheme Extended to Other Sectors </u></li>
			<br><br>Threshold limit for EPCG Zero-Duty Scheme for several sub-sectors under the Chemicals, Plastics and Textiles sectors has been brought down from Rs. 200 million  to Rs. 10 million. No additional Customs Duty would be charged on import of Capital Goods under Zero-Duty EPCG Scheme in Marine and Electronics Sectors.
			<br><br><li><u>EOU/EPZ - Further Rationalisation </u></li>
			<br><br>Net foreign exchange earning as a percentage of exports (NEEP) requirement for the units operating in EPZ and EOUs has been made uniform at 20%. However, for Hardware Units, Bio-technology and Toys sectors, this NFE requirement has been reduced to positive NFEP. The entitlement of DTA sale has been increased to 50% of the FOB value of the preceding year.
			<br><br>The procedure for operation of the units in the EPZ and EOUs have been simplified considerably and a number of operations have been permitted on the basis of self-certification.
			<br><br>The EOU/EPZ imots shall have the option to supply the goods to Bonded Warehouse for exports.
			<br><br><li><u>Export House/ Trading House/ Star Trading House/ Super Star Trading House </u></li>
			<br><br> All such exporters who attain Export House/ Trading House/ Star Trading House/ Super Star Trading House status for three successive terms or more shall be eligible for Golden Status Certificate which would enable them to enjoy all the benefits in perpetuity irrespective of their actual performance in future.
			<br><br><li><u>Other Steps </u></li>
			<br><br>In line with the facility of free imports of components for textile garments sector, leather garment and handicraft exporters have been allowed export of samples upto US$10,000 per consignment has been allowed. Limit of import of bonafide technical and trade samples appearing in restricted list has been increased from Rs. 3,000/-  per consignment to Rs. 1,00,000/-  per consignment.
			<br><br><li><u>Integration of Indian Economy with Global Economy </u></li>
			<br><br>To ensure easy access to inputs and to integrate with the global economy as many as 894 items have been added to the free list of imports. 414 additional items have also been put in the SIL list of imports.]
			<br><br>Out of aforesaid 894 items shifted to OGL list, 245 items are having small scale angle either due to their reservation for manufacture in the small scale sector or having a strong production base. Out of 245 items, 158 items pertained to Reservation list and 87 are having strong small scale production base. Further, these 158 items pertained to 76 product groups which are reserved for manufacture in the small scale sector. Out of these 76 product groups, certain items in respect of 12 reserved items were already under OGL. As such, there was a net addition of 64 reserved items to OGL list on 1/4/99. Prior to 3/2/99, 518 items reserved for manufacture in the small scale were allowed for import under OGL.
			<br><br> Subsequently, 6 items were dereserved on 3/2/99. Therefore, the total reserved items allowed for import prior to 31.3.99 were 512 and as on 1/4/99, 576 (512 + 64) items are allowed for import under OGL. Liberalisation of Import Policy, for small scale sector means easy availability of raw material and other inputs for the SSI units. It will also encourage SSI units to become efficient and competitive in terms of Price and Quality so as to compete in the world market.
			<br><br><li><u>Free Trade Zones</u></li>
			<br><br>Free Trade Zones  operational from 1.7.99. Units in free trade Zone shall be permitted to carry out any manufacturing or trading activities. They shall not be subjected to any predetermined value addition, export obligation, input-output/wastage norms. They shall be treated as outside the Customs territory of the country and the Customs shall be manning only entry and exit points. Sale in the DTA will be permitted on payment of full Custom Duty.

	<p><a name="promotion"></a><h3>Export Promotion Programmes / Measures</h3>
			<p><b>Participation in International Fairs/Exhibitions</b>
			<p>With a view to ensure that exporters from small scale sector exhibit their products in the International Exhibitions, required assistance & support is provided. Expenditure on account of space rent, handling and clearing charges, insurance and shipment charges etc. are met by the office of the Development Commissioner (Small Scale Industries) under one of the plan schemes.
			<p>During 2000-2001, O/o the DC(MSME) participated in 7 International Trade Fairs/ Exhibitions. Participation in the named fairs/exhibitions generated large number of Trade enquiries besides certain export orders. It also provided an opportunity to MSME units to display their products in the world market. During the current financial year, it is proposed to participate in 8-9 International fairs/ exhibitions. The basic objective behind this scheme is that MSME units which otherwise are not in a position to display their products may participate in foreign exhibition/fairs so as to promote their exports. Enquiries generated during such exhibitions abroad are disseminated to all MSME units through a net work of field offices of this organisation. This strategy has been found to be successful for exporters from small scale sector in identifying new foreign buyers/markets.
